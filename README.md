# Bash-script-that-generates-an-HTML-file

Bash script that generates an HTML file for a website selling shoes:


To use this script, simply save it as a .sh file (e.g., shoes.sh), make it executable (chmod +x shoes.sh), and run it (./shoes.sh). It will generate an HTML file called shoes.html in the same directory as the script. You can then open the HTML file in a web browser to see the generated website.
